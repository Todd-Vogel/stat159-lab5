##Statistics 159 Lab 5

User A; Todd Vogel  
User B; Abby Vogel

#### Questions:

**Task 1**

We have both been utilizing terminal to create files and push them to our shared github repository. However, we have only been working and different times and using the same files.

**Task 2**

This conflict was because we were working at the same time on the same branch. To resolve this issue, I had to first pull again after Todd made changes. Then git created a merge for us and resulted in this: 


><<<<<<< HEAD
>My edit is better
>=======
>Both editing at the same time ;)
>>>>>>>> 81c4151656dbbd0768a4d57cf2758d4aa1d7a627


We were instructed to clean this up, so we did. 

**Task 3**

User A is updating the master branch, while collaborator User B is updating and merging a new branch. If both people are practicing good adding/commiting and push/pulling, there should be no issues with the merges. 

**Task 4**

We are both working on multiple branches and updating different files. We ran into no conflicts when working through the add/commit/pull/push/checkouts commands in the correct order.

**Task 5**

We are both working on the same file in different branches. We ran into no conflicts when working through the add/commit/pull/push/checkouts commands in the correct order.
